  "Operations related to 'streams'.  A 'stream' is the generic term for any kind of message channel in the Symphony platform, and come in several flavours:
1. 1:1 chat
2. M:M chat
3. room
4. wall post

The primary difference between chats and rooms is that rooms have dynamic membership whereas the membership of a chat is fixed at creation time.

In addition, each type of stream can be 'internal' (intra-pod) or 'external' (include users from 1 other pod)."
