# clj-symphony

This WIP library is intended to be an idiomatic Clojure wrapper for the [symphony-java-client](https://github.com/symphonyoss/symphony-java-client) library.

## Installation

clj-symphony is available as a Maven artifact from [Clojars](https://clojars.org/org.symphonyoss/clj-symphony).
Plonk the following in your project.clj :dependencies, `lein deps` and you should be good to go:

```clojure
[org.symphonyoss/clj-symphony "#.#.#"]   ; Where #.#.# is replaced with an actual version number
```

The latest version is:

### Trying it Out
Alternatively, you may prefer to kick the library's tyres without creating a project.  This is a snap with the awesome [`lein try` plugin](https://github.com/rkneufeld/lein-try):

```shell
$ lein try org.symphonyoss/clj-symphony 0.1.0-SNAPSHOT
```

You will be dropped in a REPL with the library downloaded and ready for use.

## Usage

The functionality is provided by the `clj-symphony.api` namespace.

Require it in the REPL (incl. a `lein try` REPL):

```clojure
(require '[clj-symphony.api :as symph] :reload-all)
```

Require it in your project:

```clojure
(ns my-app.core
  (:require [clj-symphony.api :as symph]))
```

[Detailed API documentation is published here](https://symphonyoss.github.io/clj-symphony/).
